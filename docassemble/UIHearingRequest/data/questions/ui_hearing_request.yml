  title: Respond to a lawsuit
  short title: Respond to a lawsuit
  comment: This program helps you respond to a lawsuit by telling the court and the other parties that you are participating in a court case. It can make a Jury Request if you want a jury and a judge to decide your case. It also makes an Answer that tells how you respond to what is written in the complaint or petition.
